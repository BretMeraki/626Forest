Start identity shift from \"person who thinks about filming\" to \"person who films\"\n\nForest correctly identified this as perfect match for his current 10-minute window and medium energy level.

Tasks that should depend on others are showing as independent.\n\n2. TASK AVAILABILITY INCONSISTENCY: Debug shows 4 available tasks, but earlier get_next_task only returned 1 task. System state is inconsistent.\n\n3. HTA TREE GENERATION ISSUE: When we built the HTA tree, it showed \"Frontier Nodes: 0\" which suggests the tree structure wasn't properly created, even though we then generated 11 tasks.\n\n4. PREREQUISITE DEPTH CONFUSION: Debug shows multiple tasks with \"depth: 0\" that should have prerequisites, indicating the dependency chain is broken.\n\nThese are critical bugs that would prevent Alex from progressing properly through the learning sequence.

Overly vague responses (\"I do not have sufficient reliable information\")\n2. Generic responses that avoid the actual question\n3. Self-critiques that don't match the actual response content\n4. Responses that seem to misunderstand the context entirely\n\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR: Should provide honest, direct analysis of technical issues, bugs, and system problems while acknowledging uncertainty where appropriate.\n\nACTUAL BEHAVIOR: Avoiding analysis entirely or giving irrelevant generic advice.\n\nUSER REQUIREMENT: Every response must be filtered through truthful first, no exceptions. This means the truthful system must be fixed to actually work before proceeding with Alex's test case or any other development.",
  "truthful_system_diagnosis": "TRUTHFUL SYSTEM ROOT CAUSE FOUND:\n\nThe truthful system is implemented in server-modular.js lines 667-750 with these problems:\n\n1. OVERLY GENERIC HEURISTICS: The generateHeuristicAnswer() function has canned responses that avoid actual analysis:\n   - Default: \"I do not have sufficient reliable information\"\n   - Advice questions: \"I cannot give personalized advice without context\"\n   - These sidestep the actual technical questions being asked\n\n2. MISSING CONTEXT ACCESS: The truthful system doesn't have access to the actual Forest system state, so it can't analyze:\n   - Task sequencing bugs\n   - HTA tree structure issues  \n   - Dependency chain problems\n   - System inconsistencies\n\n3. DESIGNED FOR GENERIC AI SAFETY, NOT DEBUG ANALYSIS: The system is built to avoid overconfidence and flattery, but we need it to provide honest technical analysis of code and system behavior.\n\nFIX NEEDED: The truthful system needs to:\n- Access actual system state and debug information\n- Provide specific technical analysis instead of generic disclaimers\n- Maintain honesty while being actually useful for development debugging\n- Filter ALL responses with real analysis, not avoidance",

REQUESTS OBSERVABLE DATA: Asks for specific debug output, error messages, code sections instead of giving generic disclaimers  \n3. PROVIDES CONTEXT-SPECIFIC RESPONSES: Different responses for Forest system issues, HTA problems, code bugs\n4. MAINTAINS HONESTY: Still acknowledges limitations but offers to analyze what can be observed\n5. DEVELOPMENT-FOCUSED: Designed for debugging and technical work rather than generic AI safety\n\nNEW BEHAVIOR:\n- Bug questions: \"I can analyze bugs if you provide specific error messages, stack traces, or observable behavior\"\n- Forest issues: \"I can analyze HTA structures, task dependencies, and sequencing issues if you share the specific system output\"\n- Code problems: \"I can identify logical flaws, syntax issues, or structural problems in provided code\"\n\nNEXT: Test the fixed truthful system with our Forest debugging to see if it now provides useful analysis instead of avoidance.",

This indicates:\n\n1. The MCP server is running from cached/old code\n2. Our local file changes haven't been loaded by the running server\n3. We need to restart the MCP server to pick up the new truthful system logic\n\nPROBLEM: We can't test if the truthful system fix works because the server is running old code, and we can't restart it easily due to PATH issues with node command.\n\nSOLUTION NEEDED: Either fix the PATH issue to restart the server, or find a way to test the new truthful logic directly without going through the MCP interface.",

Our code fixes exist in the file but aren't loaded.\n\nIMPLICATION: We cannot proceed with ANY Forest development or Alex's test case until this is fixed, as all responses must go through truthful first per user requirements.\n\nWORKAROUND NEEDED: Since we can't restart the server, we need to either:\n1.

Multiple middleware approaches to force automatic filtering:\n   - Wrap server.callTool \n   - Intercept transport.send\n   - Wrap individual tool handlers\n4.

A flag (insideTruthfulCall) to track if we're already filtering\n2. Early return for ask_truthful/ask_truthful_claude tools\n3. Proper error handling with finally block to reset flag\n\nSTATUS: Created fixed middleware code with recursion protection",

Remove ALL middleware code from run() method\n2. Instead, wrap individual tool handlers AFTER they're registered\n3. Exclude ask_truthful and other meta tools from wrapping\n4. Make askTruthfulClaude generate responses directly without calling tools\n\nThis approach:\n- Avoids recursion completely (ask_truthful is never wrapped)\n- Still filters all other tool responses\n- Works with the existing tool architecture\n- No complex recursion protection needed",
