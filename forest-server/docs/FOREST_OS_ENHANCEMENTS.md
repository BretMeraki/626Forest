## üîß Integration Points

### Server Integration
The enhanced modules are fully integrated into the main `CleanForestServer` class:

```javascript
// Enhanced modules initialization
this.performanceMonitor = new PerformanceMonitor({...});
this.backgroundProcessor = new BackgroundProcessor({...});
this.taskBatcher = new TaskBatcher({...});
this.contextLearningSystem = new ContextLearningSystem({...});
this.adaptiveResourceAllocator = new AdaptiveResourceAllocator(...);
this.metricsDashboard = new MetricsDashboard(...);
```

### MCP Tools Integration
Three new MCP tools have been added:

1. **`get_performance_metrics`**: Comprehensive system performance and health status
2. **`get_metrics_dashboard`**: Visual dashboard with all system metrics
3. **`optimize_resources`**: Trigger adaptive resource optimization
